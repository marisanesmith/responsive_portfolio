# responsive_portfolio

This portfolio serves as my online resume with an about me section, a contact page, and a portfolio page to show of the projects that I have created during my time in the web development bootcamp. I have also included a photography page to showcase my work as a travel photographer. Located on the About Me page you will find links to my LinkedIn profile and GitHub page where you can view my additional projects and respositories.
